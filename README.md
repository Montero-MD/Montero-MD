 Hi, Iâ€™m Matthew David G. Montero


I am a 19-year-old Computer Science undergrad of West Visayas State University. My hobbies include listening to music, learning all things tech and cars, cooking, watching movies, playing video games, and exercise. I love talking about technology â€“ specifically phones, consoles, and PCs. I am also a car enthusiast interested in cars of all shapes and sizes, from sedans commonly seen driving around today to classic SUVs of the 90s.


 I have basic knowledge in various programming languages such as: C, C++, HTML, CSS.
